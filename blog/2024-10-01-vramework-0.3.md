# Announcing Vramework 0.3: Get more by doing less

I'm happy to announce vramework version 0.3!

This was a pretty quick update after 0.2, and is mostly focused on trying to improve the developer experience.

As mentioned in the previous blogpost, I had just discovered [encore.ts](https://encore.dev/) and was both validated and a bit terrified of the similarities between our frameworks. There are alot of benefits of using `encore.ts` directly, such as getting your infrastructure setup directly, having a server written in rustJS with huge performance gains, and having their repos automatically split into microservices.

In terms of placement, I would like to think vramework lives inbetween the world of nestJS and encore. There's less boilerplate than nestJS, but you can still rely on all the opensource nodeJS libraries that exist. These could be like backend servers such as uWS/Fastify/Express or using a dispatch pattern in NextJS (and likely other frameworks).

I personally also like the idea of being able to fully control my infrastructure via a declarative language like terraform. I can understand this is a personal choice and I definately see the value in encore.ts fully fledged solution, but the goal of this library is to try and do one thing (api routing and HTTP API documentation) and leave the rest up to the users preferences.

## What changed

Typescript offers pretty advanced types that can be used to create useful developer experiences beyond just API calls (as shown in [kysely](https://kysely.dev/), my prefered sql query builder).

In vramework we leaned a bit on this compiler to be able to extract important information automatically, which means we can now benefit from both stronger static type checking during compilation to deriving information which can be used for runtime validation.

### Improved API / developer experience

In vramework 0.2 and prior creating a route looked like this:

```typescript
export const routes = [
  route({
    method: 'post',
    route: '/blog/:blogId/comment',
    schema: 'AddCommentToBlog',
    func: addCommentToBlog,
    permissions: {
      canCommentOnBlog,
    },
  }),
];
```

The main issue with this approach was primarily that we had to manually specify the `schema` property in order for it to be validated against.

In vramework 0.3 we now use the following API:

```typescript
import { addRoute } from './api'

addRoute({
    method: 'post',
    route: '/blog/:blogId/comment',
    func: addCommentToBlog,
    permissions: {
      canCommentOnBlog,
    },
    query: []
})
```

Which now allows us to do some more advanced typescript validation:

- `AddCommentToBlog` schema is automatically retrieved from the function generic params
- `blogId` needs to exist within `AddCommentToBlog` since it's a parameter
- `query` has been added as an array of fields that exist in `AddCommentToBlog`, which will be used for documentation purposes

### API Interfaces

We now generate an API interface, which would allow us to apply typings in the dispatcher in NextJS (and other frameworks that dispatch calls). 

```typescript
export type RoutesInterface = { route: '/books', method: 'post', input: null, output: Books } |
        { route: '/book', method: 'post', input: CreateBook, output: Book } |
put: null, output: Books } |
        { route: '/book', method: 'post', input: CreateBook, output
: Book } |
        { route: '/book/:id', method: 'get', input: JustBookId, out
put: Book } |
        { route: '/book/:id', method: 'patch', input: null, output:
 Book } |
        { route: '/book/:id', method: 'delete', input: JustBookId, 
output: boolean }
```

## Addressing the contradiction in the 0.2 blog

To quote the previous the previous blog:

> Vramework avoids the "magic" often found in other frameworks, where hidden processes can make debugging challenging. By providing explicit and transparent code structures, you gain full control over your application's behavior.

To me this also included the idea of having a global store for routes. I'm normally not a fan of singleton states in codebases, which certainly conflicts with a few nodeJS framework implementations.

Previously we needed to export a `routes` array, and the build concatenated them together. The benefit of this was that you could create multiple different route files and specify which routes you want to run by simply retrieving the routes from a specific file. This was the main approach behind deploying microservices.

The disadvantage of this approach was that it was really hard to do the typescript validation. It's still a well known pattern in nodeJS (using `export default`), but felt as an API decision would ultimately be a bit more confusing.

We ended up switching to the `addRoute` method instead, which registers all the APIs we want.
